# SparkCorr

Distributed algorithms to compute distances between all pairs of points (within some range) on a sphere for very large datasets (meaning hundred of millions to billions of objects). Mostly used in astronomy but certainly usefull in many places.
* See details in the paper folder or [online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08455)
* includes an amazing new progressive pixelization of the sphere (SARSPix) much more adatpted to distance tests (as kNN, crossmatches etc.)
* Class documentation available [here](https://astrolabsoftware.github.io/SparkCorr/#package)
